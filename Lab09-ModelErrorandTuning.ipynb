But, we wouldn't get to error = 1 unless nothing worked at all. From this graph we can see a point of inflection where we may find give and take between overfitting and too few k's"

    "Ultimately, the goal of any prediction model is to make predictions on _future_ data. Therein lies the problem with training error. Training error measures how well a model predicts on the current data. It is possible to build a model that **overfits** to the training data---that is, a model that fits so well to the current data that it does poorly on future data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider fitting two different models to the 10 training observations shown below. The model represented by the red line actually passes through every observation (that is, its training error is zero). However, most people would prefer the model represented by the blue line. If one had to make a prediction for $y$ when $x = 0.8$, the value of the blue line is intuitively more plausible than the value of the red line, which is out of step with the nearby points.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/overfitting.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument for the blue model depends on _future_ data because the blue model is actually worse than the red model on the current data. The red model tries so hard to get the predictions on the training data right that it ends up _overfitting_.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the goal is to build a model that performs well on future data, then we ought to evaluate it (i.e., by calculating MSE, MAE, etc.) on future data. The prediction error on future data is also known as **test error**, in contrast to training error, which is the prediction error on current data. To calculate the test error, we need _labeled_ future data. In many applications, future data is expensive to collect and _labeled_ future data is even more expensive. How can we approximate the test error, using just the data that we have?"

    "\n",
    "Previously, we carried out cross validation by splitting the data into 2 halves, alternately using one half to train the model and the other to evaluate the model. In general, we can split the data into $k$ subsamples, alternately training the data on $k-1$ subsamples and evaluating the model on the $1$ remaining subsample, i.e., the validation set. This produces $k$ somewhat independent estimates of the test error. This procedure is known as **$k$-fold cross validation**. (Be careful not to confuse the $k$ in $k$-fold cross validation with the $k$ in $k$-nearest neighbors.) Therefore, the specific version of cross validation that we saw earlier is $2$-fold cross validation.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. split the data into $k$ subsamples\n",
    "2. combine the first $k-1$ subsamples into a training set and train the model\n",
    "3. evaluate the model predictions on the last ($k$th) held-out subsample\n",

    "4. calculate $k$ \"scores\", one from each validation set\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one subtlety to keep in mind. Training a $k$-nearest neighbors model is not just about fitting the model; it also involves dummifying the categorical variables and scaling the variables. These preprocessing steps should be included in the cross-validation process. They cannot be done ahead of time.\n",

    "For example, suppose we run $5$-fold cross validation. Then:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We cannot simply standardize all of the data once at the beginning and run cross validation on the standardized data. To do so would be allowing the model to peek at the validation set during training. That's because each training set would be standardized with respect to a mean and SD that is calculated from all data, including the validation set. To be completely above board, we should standardize each training set with respect to the mean and SD of just that training set.\n",
